# Stoplight 

### Description:
This is a small program that will linearly flash three LEDs to mimic an American stoplight. First, the green LED will illuminate for 4 seconds. It will then turn off and the yellow LED will illuminate for 2 seconds. Following that, the yellow LED will turn off and the red LED will illuminate for 3 seconds. The cycle will then repeat.

### Requirements:
1x MEGA 2560  
1x Breadboard  
6x Wires  
3x 220ohm Resistors  
3x LEDs
